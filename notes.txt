  "following the medieval custom of writing key words in red in the margins of
  important books."

  Imagine: A DecoratedScripton has KeyWords, seemingly at random?, all out of
  the WordVectors?, in the Margins.  WHen they are followed, they reveal an
  DisturbingErrorMessage, followed by a DisturbingErrorHandler, followed by a
  SubmissionForm. 
  
  I have this further fantasy that there are ImagesWithWords that are
  interesting enough to clue the reader in that they are WordsToSearchFor. 
  
  WHen doing so, they should open up content with further secret messages. I had
  this idea where a particular book has its ISBN pictured, and then pictures of
  the words that I highlighted in them, only there's ALSO a secret word in the
  bolded text. This is the text that I can communicate without fear of being
  punished. This is probably the video text. It should be a cool easter egg that
  tells the viewer, Hey cool you found this... you can go now and think about
  it. 
  
  Or, to be less twee, it just opens up MoreCompletedContent, which is
  guaranteed by mongodb to have been edited since the inception of the Magic
  Typewriter. Perhaps you can 'like' the content, which has joke possibilities
  or the possibility of fucking with Facebook. Facefreaking?

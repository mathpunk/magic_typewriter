= Vim behaving badly =

== Buffers == 
Buffers aren't working like I'd expect -- I tried to move some text using "a and
"A and in buffer 'a' was crap from many days ago. 

The clipboard buffer is not working like I'd expect-- I used to be able to "+p
and paste from the clipboard. 

There is a save problem that I haven't seen in a while, but it's alarming when
it does happen.

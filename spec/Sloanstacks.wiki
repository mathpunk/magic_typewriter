"A cybertext requires that some sort of computation happens when reading is

Sloan's stacks, with the result of YOUR click being autogenerated."-me

No seriously, imagine that. Imagine Robin SLoan's stacks, with the textons
permuted algorithmically (even if randomly). An opportunity to connect directly
with a person's data. So what data would they give to us in exchange for ours?
Remember that part of the data is in the instinct of the actors.>>

That would mean a good time estimate, and compelling content every 15 seconds.
Excellent, I can work on that level of detail.

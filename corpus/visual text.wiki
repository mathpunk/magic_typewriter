== Visual Text and Markup ==

Surely we are not naive enough to think that the appearance of a text is not a crucial part of a text. Therefore, the CSS and HTML with which we deliver textons online ought not to live in Git alone, but be part of the textonic corpus. (JS is another matter, specifically a matter of security, if we ever move towards world-writeable textons. However we seem not to be for the moment, so maybe it can be in play too? Or maybe we're already pushing the boundaries of sanity.)

We also want good defaults for each texton type, for authors who prefer not to deal with this.

What are our preferences here? Does this live in the "magic" portion of a texton (which I don't fully understand)? Is it most sensibly done as a new bit of syntax?

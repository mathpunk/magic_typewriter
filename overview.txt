Some jerk writes a bunch of text. 
  It is in a directory.
  It is structured, but inconsistently.
    There may be unknown sigils, symbols developed on the fly, attempts at
invocations, such as tk or #( or what have you.

XtremeVersionControl
  I don't get it, but it's some sort of interaction between Textons and MongoDB
and vim's actions on the filesystem. If I can do it without breaking anything,
I'll pull the code from "Textino" into Textons, and save the super-fun
Textino/Antitextino wording for this part of the project.

A query -- quite likely a chain of them, perhaps in a block -- is strung
together and sent to a collection of Textons (which might inherently be a
Scripton; you might want to include Enumerable, and implement .each by having it
act on an @Array. 

A completed query generates:
  A Summary
    So that you know if this scripton is just too big to work with -- hm, so
you're saying Summary matters more for the Author? Perhaps there could also be
an ObscuredSummary, for the Readers to navigate. 
  A Scripton
    There's sort of a 'trivial scripton' by concatenating everything, in the
order you've got it. There's permuting. There's sorting by fields. 

  I guess I'm saying, the block/function dividing line is not so clear.
